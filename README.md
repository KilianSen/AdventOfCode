# AoC 2024
A collection of my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 puzzles.
I don't really spend much time on these, so they are mostly quick and dirty solutions.
Or sometimes absolute abominations of code (Day 3, I'm looking at you xD).

### Day 1
Probably the worst solution to this puzzle.

- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

### Day 2
Used a quick class based solution for this one.
Nothing special, nor elegant. Just a quick.

- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

### Day 3
I wanted to challenge myself to solve this with the least loc.
So I did. And it's a mess. But it works. It's two lines per part.
First line is reading the file with `open` and the second line,
is a mix of regex and list comprehension to solve the puzzle.
